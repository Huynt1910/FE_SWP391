    hint: Updates were rejected because a pushed branch tip is behind its remote counterpart.
    hint: If you want to integrate the remote changes, use 'git pull' before pushing again.

Follow these steps:

1. Fetch and merge remote changes:
   ```sh
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. Resolve any merge conflicts, if present.
3. Push your changes:
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```
